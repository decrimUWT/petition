					<p>The Decriminalize UWT working group is a collection of faculty, staff, and students working for the University of Washington Tacoma's divestment from the Tacoma Police Department and other law enforcement agencies, in order to ensure the health and safety of people on campus, particularly Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC).</p>

					<h3>Values</h3>
					<ul class="alt2">
						<li><b>Antiracism:</b> This decriminalization campaign is one part of the broader work of dismantling racism on our campus.</li>
						<li><b>Safety over security:</b> The safety and well-being of people must be prioritized over the security of property interests.</li>
						<li><b>BIPOC at the center:</b> The experiences of BIPOC students, staff, faculty, and Tacoma community members vulnerable to law enforcement violence must be at the center of the work to reimagine campus safety.</li>
						<li><b>Outrage:</b> Anger about racism is warranted, and outrage is a resource.</li>
						<li><b>Perseverance:</b> We will remain committed and persistent in our goal of UWT divestment from law enforcement agencies.</li>
						<li><b>Community engagement:</b> We recognize that UWT policies impact people beyond UWT students, staff, and faculty.</li>
						<li><b>Education:</b> We recognize that education (of self and with others) is at the heart of organizing.</li>
						<li><b>Solidarity:</b> This work represents an opportunity for white faculty, staff, and students to stand in anti-racist solidarity with BIPOC communities who are systematically impacted by law enforcement violence.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>History & Timeline</h3>
					<p>Decriminalize UW Tacoma is part of a larger tri-campus organizing effort to <a href="https://decriminalizeuw.com/about/" target="_blank">Decriminalize the University of Washington</a>.</p>
					<p>In early June 2020, members of the UW Seattle campus community launched a petition containing the following demands:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<ol>
							<li>Immediately stop handing over people detained by UW Police Department to local law enforcement.</li>
							<li>Stop using SPD to respond to public safety needs, including referrals for welfare checks under the Safe Campus program.</li>
							<li>Stop using SPD for additional security for any events, including football games, concerts, and ceremonies.</li>
							<li>Disarm UWPD officers.</li>
							<li>Ban the use of police dogs by UWPD, which many communities of color in the US associate with the terror of state violence.</li>
							<li>Publicly commit to not hiring former police officers with disciplinary records as UW Police Officers.</li>
						</ol>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Within weeks, more than 10,000 people and hundreds of campus and community organizations had endorsed the petition. The Coalition to Decriminalize the University of Washington (Seattle) includes 150 campus-based organizations including the campus Black Student Union, the African Students Association, and the UW Black Lives Matter chapter, as well as faculty, staff, and students of the UW.</p>

					<p>In mid-June, members of the UW Bothell and Tacoma campuses launched similar petitions, in solidarity with organizers on the Seattle campus, the national Black Lives Matter movement, and the families of Manny Ellis, Bennie Branch, and other Black, Brown, and Indigenous people killed by the Tacoma Police.</p>

					<p>The Decriminalize UW Tacoma petition calls for the university to divest from the Tacoma Police Department (TPD) and invest in non-police alternatives for ensuring the health and safety of campus community members, particularly Black, Indigenous, and other persons of color (BIPOC).</p>

					<p>It contains five concrete demands:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Stop using TPD to respond to referrals for welfare checks under the Safe Campus program.</li>
						<li>Stop using TPD for additional security for any campus events.</li>
						<li>Do not replace TPD presence with any other armed law enforcement agency.</li>
						<li>Publicly commit to not hiring former police officers with disciplinary records to UWT Security</li>
						<li>Publicly commit to never inviting Customs and Border Patrol or Immigration and Customs Enforcement to campus for any reason.</li>
					</ol>

					<p>After gaining an endorsement of the UWT Faculty Assembly and the Executive Board of the Associated Students, as well as support from the UWT Staff Association, the UWT Faculty Assembly chair and co-chair submitted the petition to Chancellor Mark Pagano.</p>

					<p>In response to our petition, Chancellor Pagano failed to acknowledge our demand to immediately divest from TPD and has only agreed to demand #4. He also pledged to “hold a series of listening and strategy sessions with members of the UW Tacoma community that focuses on how we can build and enhance our campus safety culture in ways that promote inclusivity and antiracism,” and said that the tri-campus Safe Campus program will work to “minimize the reliance on armed first‐responders and expand the use of unarmed first‐responders to visit those who may be in crisis.”</p>

					<p>The first of these listening sessions took place October 28, 2020. While the administration was able to provide more detail on its efforts to minimize the reliance on armed officers for welfare checks, no firm commitments were made. Further listening sessions have not yet been scheduled, and the working group will continue to hold the administration accountable to its existing commitments and press for stronger commitments to ensure the safety of all UWT community members.</p>
