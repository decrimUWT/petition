						<h2>Petition to Decriminalize UW Tacoma</h2>

					<p>As members of the University of Washington (Tacoma) community, we call on Chancellor Mark Pagano and Executive Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs Jill Purdy to take immediate action to ensure the health and safety of people on campus, particularly Black, Indigenous, and other persons of color (BIPOC), by protecting them from state sanctioned violence by law enforcement agencies.</p>
					<p>The national <a href="https://blacklivesmatter.com/defundthepolice/" target="_blank">Movement For Black Lives</a> has given the UW community an invitation to uphold our values of justice, equity, and anti-racism, and to immediately divest from the Tacoma Police Department (TPD) and similar agencies to protect our BIPOC community members. We bear witness to the ongoing harms that police violence enacts against BIPOC community members in our community and around the nation. In the interests of public health and safety, we call on the University of Washington Tacoma to take the following steps:
						<ol>
							<li>Stop using TPD to respond to referrals for welfare checks under the Safe Campus program.</li>
							<li>Stop using TPD for additional security for any campus events.</li>
							<li>Do not replace TPD presence with any other armed law enforcement agency.</li>
							<li>Publicly commit to not hiring former police officers with disciplinary records to UWT Security.</li>
							<li>Publicly commit to never inviting CBP or ICE to campus for any reason.</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
 					<p>If UW’s institutional organization means that Chancellor Pagano does not have the authority to make any of these changes on UWT’s campus, we demand that he advocate for these changes to UW President Ana Mari Cauce.</p>
					<p>We have seen—not just in the current moment—the dangers that armed police officers present, particularly to BIPOC students, faculty, and staff. The presence of armed officers increases the chance of someone in our campus community being hurt or killed. These are longstanding concerns. Moving forward, we argue that reimagining Safe Campus requires greater investment in alternative structures of care and a rethinking of policing itself in ways that do not rely on militarized state violence.</p>
					<p>The issues we raise are not specific to UW Tacoma. We support all related efforts at UW Seattle and UW Bothell to protect our BIPOC community members. College leaders across the nation, notably the University of Minnesota, have taken decisive action to divest from city police departments. Though we recognize that divestment alone is not sufficient for achieving racial justice, it is an important step. We invite UW leadership to support our campus community by joining this national movement and enacting these changes.</p>

					<p><i>The petition to Decriminalize UWT has been signed by over 100 individuals, representing UWT faculty, staff, alumni, students, and community members.
